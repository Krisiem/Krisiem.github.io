        I have a fiance. I am in school at the moment going to three different places for school to be real. I have to do Earn and Learn, Opertion Spark 
        and Delgado. I go to them all for different things like Earn and Learn is for soft skills, Opertion Spark is to learn to code, and Delgado is for 
        ACE where I am learning Health Information Technology.  I am also someone that cares little of herself and a lot about other people. I am a diabetic 
        and when it comes to that I am not all for it I really don't care, but now it is time to do it asap.  I am making this website to give tips on how to
